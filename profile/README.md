# Wellcome Collection

**We are a software development team for a free museum and library that aims to challenge how we all think and feel about health.**

Digital media and services are vital to our mission, they include:

* A unified search for all our collections, both [on our website](https://wellcomecollection.org/collections) and [as open APIs](https://developers.wellcomecollection.org/docs/api)
* Access to millions of digitised images through [IIIF APIs](https://developers.wellcomecollection.org/images), shared with open and permissive licences
* Long-form narrative content published at [https://wellcomecollection.org/stories](https://wellcomecollection.org/stories)

We work in the open, so that others can learn from our mistakes and successes. All the services  we've built in-house are open source, made available under an MIT licence.
