# ðŸ‘‹ Hello

The Wellcome Collection are building a digital platform for Wellcome Collection, enabling us to improve the experience we offer to readers and researchers. We aim to make it easier for third-party developers to build things with our data and collections.

This means providing programmatic access to our digital assets, metadata and web content by developing a simple, unified and coherent set of APIs.

You can read documentation for our APIs at <https://developers.wellcomecollection.org/>.

## Developing in the open

We develop in the open, so that others can learn from our mistakes and successes. We  want to be transparent on the state of work in progress and provide a forum to raise issues and discuss our approach.

Everything we create will be open-source, under an MIT license. We will package things that are useful to others as standalone components, so that they can be easily re-used outside of our platform.
